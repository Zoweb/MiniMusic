# MiniMusic
Create, edit, view and play MiniMusic files

## Developing
MiniMusic is created in Visual Studio. Therefore, before anything else, you'll need to have it installed. I recommend 2017. No promises that anything will work in an earlier version.

Once you've installed VS, clone this repository to your VS projects directory. Then, open the `MME.sln` file in Visual Studio to load the MiniMusic projects. This includes:
 - MiniMusic.Editor
 - More to come soon..

Edit the files then create a pull request to contribute.
